# Getting Started

Welcome to Doclific! This guide will help you get started with the project, whether you're a user or a contributor.

## What is Doclific?

Doclific is an internal documentation tool that features a modern, Notion-like rich text editor for creating and managing your project documentation. Built with a powerful CLI and a beautiful web interface, Doclific makes it easy to document your codebase, APIs, and project knowledge.

## Key Features

* **Notion-like Editor**: Rich text editing experience with support for headings, lists, code blocks, and more
* **Codebase Integration**: Reference code snippets directly from your repository
* **Smart Navigation**: Organized folder structure for easy documentation management
* **Fast & Local**: Runs entirely on your machine - no external services required
* **Auto-Updates**: Automatically checks for and installs updates

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install Doclific with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muellerluke/doclific/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This will:

* Download the latest release for your platform
* Install the binary to `/usr/local/bin` (or `~/.local/bin` if you don't have write permissions)
* Set up the frontend build files
* Automatically add skills for Cursor and Claude Code

### Initialize a Project

1. Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

2. Initialize Doclific:

```bash
doclific init
```

This creates a `doclific` folder structure where your documentation will be stored.

3. Start the server:

```bash
doclific
```

The server will automatically open your browser to the web interface at `http://localhost:6767`.

## Project Structure

After running `doclific init`, your project will have:

```
your-project/
└── doclific/
    └── [documentation folders]/
        ├── config.json
        └── content.mdx
```

Each documentation folder contains:

* `config.json`: Metadata (title, icon, order)
* `content.mdx`: The documentation content in MDX format

## Using Cursor or Claude Code

Doclific includes skills that allow Cursor and Claude Code to automatically generate documentation for your project. Simply ask:

```
Write documentation for the "Getting Started" document
```

or

```
Create an ERD diagram for my database schema
```

See the [Skills System](/31d11840-d56a-412c-bca2-4940defc5fae) documentation for more details.
