# Project Structure Documentation

The Doclific project is a full-stack application consisting of a Go-based backend and a React-based frontend. It is designed to create, manage, and edit documentation using a modern web interface with AI-powered features and deep codebase integration.

## Backend (Go)

The backend provides the CLI interface, manages the documentation files, integrates with AI services, and serves the frontend application.

* `cmd/doclific/main.go`: The entry point for the application. It uses the Cobra library to provide CLI commands like `init`, `set`, `get`, and starts the web server by default.
* `internal/config/`: Manages application configuration, including AI provider keys and model preferences.
* `internal/core/`: Contains the business logic for the application, including documentation CRUD operations, AI content generation, Git integration, and codebase scanning.
* `internal/server/`: Implements the HTTP server using Go's standard library. It defines RESTful API routes and serves the static frontend build.

## Frontend (React)

The frontend is a modern SPA built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It features a sophisticated editor powered by Plate.js.

* `web/frontend/src/pages/`: Contains the main application pages, such as the editor and fallback views.
* `web/frontend/src/components/editor/`: Includes the editor configuration and custom Plate.js plugins for features like ERDs and codebase snippets.
* `web/frontend/src/api/`: TypeScript clients for interacting with the Go backend's API endpoints.
* `web/frontend/src/components/ui/`: Reusable UI components based on Radix UI primitives.

## Documentation Storage

Documentation is stored in the `doclific/` directory. Each document resides in its own folder (named with a UUID) and contains two primary files:

* `content.mdx`: The raw content of the documentation in MDX format.
* `config.json`: Metadata for the document, such as its title and icon.

## Scripts

The project includes utility scripts for managing the lifecycle of the application.

* `scripts/install.sh`: A script to handle the installation of the Doclific binary.
* `scripts/release.sh`: Facilitates the build and release process for new versions of the software.
