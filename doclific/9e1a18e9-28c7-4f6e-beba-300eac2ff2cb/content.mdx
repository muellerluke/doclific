# Development Guide

This guide will help you set up a development environment for Doclific and contribute to the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

* **Go**: Version 1.25 or higher
* **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher
* **npm**: (Usually comes with Node.js)
* **Git**

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muellerluke/doclific.git
cd doclific
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd web/frontend
npm install
cd ../..
```

### 3. Verify Go Installation

```bash
go version
```

## Development Workflow

### Running the Backend

The backend serves the API and the static files. For development, you can run it directly:

```bash
# From the project root
go run cmd/doclific/main.go
```

By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:6767`.

</CodebaseSnippet>

### Running the Frontend (Dev Mode)

For a better developer experience (HMR, fast refresh), run the frontend in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd web/frontend
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite dev server, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

> **Note**: You will need to configure the frontend to talk to the backend port (6767) if you are working on API integration.

### Building from Source

To build the full binary (which embeds the frontend):

1. **Build the Frontend**:

```bash
cd web/frontend
npm run build
cd ../..
```

This generates static files in `web/frontend/dist`.

1. **Build the Binary**:

```bash
go build -o doclific cmd/doclific/main.go
```

1. **Run the Binary**:

```bash
./doclific
```

## Project Structure

</CodebaseSnippet>

* `cmd/`: Entry point for the application (Cobra CLI commands)
* `internal/`: Private application and library code

  * `core/`: Core domain logic (Docs, Git, File System)
  * `server/`: HTTP server and API handlers
  * `config/`: Configuration management
* `web/`: Frontend source code

  * `frontend/`: React + TypeScript application
* `skills/`: AI assistant skills for Cursor and Claude Code

## Running Tests

### Backend (Go)

```bash
go test ./...
```

Key test files:

* `internal/core/docs__test.go`
* `internal/core/codebase__test.go`
* `internal/core/git__test.go`
* `internal/config/config_test.go`

### Frontend (React)

Currently, the frontend does not have a test suite set up. Contributing one would be a great way to help!

## Code Style

### Go

* Follow standard Go conventions
* Run `go fmt ./...` before committing
* Use meaningful variable and function names

### TypeScript / React

* We use **ESLint** and **Prettier**
* Run linting before pushing:

```bash
cd web/frontend
npm run lint
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a new branch for your feature or fix: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
2. Commit your changes with meaningful commit messages
3. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
4. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch
5. Describe your changes in detail and reference any related issues

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:
