# Project Structure Documentation

Doclific is a full-stack documentation tool built with a Go backend and a React frontend. It allows users to manage project documentation using a modern rich text editor with AI-powered features and deep codebase integration.

## Backend (Go)

The backend serves as a CLI tool and an API server. It handles file operations, AI integrations, and interacts with the local file system to scan codebases or manage documentation files.

* `cmd/doclific/main.go`: The entry point for the CLI application. It uses the Cobra library to provide commands like `init`, `set`, `get`, and starts the web server.
* `internal/config/`: Manages application-wide configuration, including API keys for AI providers.
* `internal/core/`: Contains the primary business logic, including document CRUD operations, codebase scanning, and Git integration.
* `internal/server/`: Implements the HTTP server and RESTful API endpoints used by the frontend.

## Frontend (React)

The frontend is a React application built with Vite and Tailwind CSS. It features a sophisticated rich text editor powered by Plate.js, customized with plugins for specialized documentation needs.

* `web/frontend/src/App.tsx`: The main application component handling routing and global providers.
* `web/frontend/src/components/editor/`: Configuration and plugin definitions for the Plate.js rich text editor.
* `web/frontend/src/components/ui/`: Reusable UI components and specialized editor nodes (e.g., ERD nodes, Codebase snippets).
* `web/frontend/src/api/`: API client functions for communicating with the Go backend.

## Documentation Storage

Documentation is stored locally in a directory named `doclific/`. Each document is organized into a subfolder named with a UUID, containing both metadata and content.

* `config.json`: Stores metadata such as the document title and icon.
* `content.mdx`: Contains the documentation content in MDX format.

## Scripts and Utilities

* `scripts/install.sh`: Shell script for installing the Doclific binary.
* `scripts/release.sh`: Script used for building and releasing new versions of the application.
