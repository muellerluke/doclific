# Project Structure

Doclific is organized as a monorepo with a Go backend and a React/TypeScript frontend. It follows standard Go project conventions for the CLI and internal logic, while housing the web interface in a dedicated directory.

## Top-Level Directories

* `cmd/`: Contains the entry point for the Doclific CLI application.
* `internal/`: Private library code, including the web server and core business logic.
* `web/`: The frontend React application built with Vite.
* `doclific/`: The default directory where user-created documentation is stored as MDX files.
* `scripts/`: Shell scripts for installation and release management.

## Backend Architecture (internal/)

The backend is divided into three main packages that handle configuration, business logic, and API delivery.

### Core Logic

The core logic is found in `internal/core`, which manages interactions with the file system and external services.

* `docs.go`: Handles reading, writing, and scanning the documentation directory.
* `codebase.go`: Provides utilities for exploring the local file system and reading source code.
* `git.go`: Integrates with local Git configuration to retrieve repository and user information.
* `ai.go`: Manages AI-assisted content generation using various providers.

### Server and API

The server package defines the HTTP API that the frontend communicates with.

## Frontend Architecture (web/)

The frontend is a modern React application using Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components. It is structured to facilitate complex editor features.

* `src/api/`: TypeScript clients for interacting with the Go backend.
* `src/components/editor/`: A feature-rich block-based editor with custom plugins.
* `src/pages/`: High-level view components like the main editor layout.
