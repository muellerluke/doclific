# Project Structure Documentation

Doclific is a full-stack documentation tool designed to run locally on a user's machine. It consists of a Go-based backend providing a CLI and a REST API, and a React-based frontend featuring a Notion-like rich text editor built with PlateJS.

## Backend (Go)

The backend is located in the root and the `internal/` directory. It manages the application lifecycle, local file system operations, and integrations with AI and Git.

* `cmd/doclific/main.go`: The entry point for the CLI. It uses the Cobra library to provide commands like `init`, `set`, and `update`. By default, it starts the web server.
* `internal/core/`: Contains the business logic. `docs.go` handles document CRUD, `ai.go` manages AI generation, and `codebase.go` scans the local file system for snippets.
* `internal/server/`: Implements the HTTP server and API routes using standard library conventions.
* `internal/config/`: Manages application-wide configuration (API keys, ports, etc.).

## Frontend (React + PlateJS)

The frontend is a modern web application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It leverages the PlateJS framework to provide a highly customizable and extensible rich text editor.

* `web/frontend/src/components/editor/`: Houses the core editor configuration and plugin system. `editor-kit.tsx` aggregates all enabled plugins, including custom ones like ERD and Codebase Snippets.
* `web/frontend/src/components/ui/`: Contains UI components based on Shadcn/ui and custom editor node implementations (e.g., `erd-node.tsx`, `codebase-snippet-node.tsx`).
* `web/frontend/src/api/`: TypeScript clients for communicating with the Go backend API.

## Data Management

Documentation content is stored locally in the `doclific/` folder within the project root. Each document is contained in its own subdirectory named with a UUID, containing:

* `content.mdx`: The actual MDX content of the document.
* `config.json`: Metadata for the document, such as the title and sidebar icon.
